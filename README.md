# hyrstgeard

## Quick Intro
After a millenia of peace and order in the massive world of Hyrstgeard, greed begins to take hold of restless minds. The expensive mistakes of past wars begin to fade from even the oldest memories. The world that was thought to be fully known, it turns out, bears many more secrets to discover, and ancient powers to tame.

## Access to Magic
There are only two known sources of magic in Hyrstgeard: ancestry & divinity:
* *Fey Ancestry*: Elves & Gnomes are races originally from the Feywild, and they innately carry the spark of wild magic within them
* *Dragon Ancestry*: Dragonborn inherit their magical abilities from their Dragon ancestors
* *Divine Bestowment*: Clerics & Paladins receive their magical powers from their deity. And if they displease their deity, their access to magic can be revoked.

And that's it: You can’t just learn you some magic (ala wizards). So all non-divine spellcasting is limited to the races above. 
Resurrection is not a thing. Death is final.

## Races
* Limited to Humans, (half) Orcs, (half) Elves, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes, Goliaths, Goblins, Dragonborn (no tieflings, yet)
