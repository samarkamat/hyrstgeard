# hyrstgeard

## Quick Intro
(doing this last)

## Themes/Tone
* Settings: Rural, small town, big cities
* Encounter Types: Spy/Espionage/Assassinations; Character Arcs; Epic Battles; Unique Environments; Hunts; Heists; Rescue Missions; Gladiator Arenas, Sporting Events
* No plans for large scale warfare (but then, whatever happens happens), expect more tactical combat. 

## Magic
There are only two known sources of magic in Hyrstgeard: ancestry & divinity:
* *Fey Ancestry*: Elves & Gnomes are races originally from the Feywild, and they innately carry the spark of wild magic within them
* *Dragon Ancestry*: Dragonborn inherit their magical abilities from their Dragon ancestors
* *Divine Bestowment*: Clerics & Paladins receive their magical powers from their deity. And if they displease their deity, their access to magic can be revoked.

And that's it: You can’t just learn you some magic (ala wizards). So all non-divine spellcasting is limited to the races above. 
Resurrection is not a thing. Death is final.

## Races
* Limited to Humans, (half) Orcs, (half) Elves, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes, Goliaths, Goblins, Dragonborn (no tieflings, yet)
