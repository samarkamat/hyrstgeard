# hyrstgeard

## Quick Intro
After a millenia of peace and order in the massive world of Hyrstgeard, unrest begins to lurk in greedy minds. The expensive mistakes of past wars begin to fade from even the oldest memories. The world that people thought they once knew, bears many more secrets to discover, and powers to tame.

## Themes/Tones/Etc
* Settings Available: Rural, small town, big cities
* Encounter Types: Standard Hero Stuff; Spy/Espionage/Assassinations; Character Arcs; Epic Battles; Unique Environments; Role Playing; Hunts; Heists; Rescue Missions; Gladiator Arenas; Sporting Events; 
* No plans for large scale warfare (but then, whatever happens happens). Expect mostly tactical combat. 

## Access to Magic
There are only two known sources of magic in Hyrstgeard: ancestry & divinity:
* *Fey Ancestry*: Elves & Gnomes are races originally from the Feywild, and they innately carry the spark of wild magic within them
* *Dragon Ancestry*: Dragonborn inherit their magical abilities from their Dragon ancestors
* *Divine Bestowment*: Clerics & Paladins receive their magical powers from their deity. And if they displease their deity, their access to magic can be revoked.

And that's it: You can’t just learn you some magic (ala wizards). So all non-divine spellcasting is limited to the races above. 
Resurrection is not a thing. Death is final.

## Races
* Limited to Humans, (half) Orcs, (half) Elves, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes, Goliaths, Goblins, Dragonborn (no tieflings, yet)
