## premise
- You are all orphans that grew up together at the Wool's Orphanage in the {NAME OF WOODS}.
- The old matron who cared for all of you, Mother Wyndel, has fallen ill. The neighboring town's cleric has called for your help.
- Mother Wyndel had been poisoned when gathering things in the woods. How she was poisoned is unclear, but her only hope is a potion made from a rare flower found on a single type of tree in the forest. 
- Mother Wyndel only has a few day's time before she would succumb, so time is of the essence.
