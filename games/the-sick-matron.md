## premise
- You were all orphans that grew up together at the Wool's Orphanage, where [Sister Wyndel](https://www.notion.so/Sister-Wyndel-cd048cb2297a4c0e9fdec306dabe81a7) took care of all of you.
- You've all since grown up and gone your separate ways.
- A few days ago, you got an urgent mail that Sister Wyndel has fallen sick, and that she needs your help.
- You all immediately arrange for time off and travel to Wool's Orphanage, anxious to help the woman who raised you, and also for the coming reunion in your childhood home.
